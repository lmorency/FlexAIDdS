## Build & Runtime Dependencies

### CMake (BSD-3-Clause)

**Project:** Cross-platform build system generator  
**License:** BSD 3-Clause License  
**Source:** https://cmake.org/  
**Use in FlexAID∆S:** Build configuration, hardware detection

---

### OpenMP (Various)

**Standard:** OpenMP API Specification  
**License:** Implementation-specific (GCC: GPL with Runtime Exception, LLVM: Apache-2.0/MIT)  
**Source:** https://www.openmp.org/  
**Use in FlexAID∆S:** CPU parallelization, thread management

**Note:** OpenMP runtime libraries include linking exceptions that permit use in non-GPL software. FlexAID∆S uses OpenMP directives without modifying compiler sources.

---

### CUDA Toolkit (NVIDIA EULA - Proprietary but Free)

**Project:** NVIDIA GPU computing platform  
**License:** NVIDIA End User License Agreement (free for research and commercial use)  
**Source:** https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit  
**Use in FlexAID∆S:** Optional GPU acceleration on NVIDIA hardware

**Note:** Not open source, but freely available. Distribution of CUDA binaries restricted by NVIDIA EULA. FlexAID∆S ships CUDA-compatible source code; users install CUDA Toolkit separately.

---

### Metal Framework (Apple Inc. - Free)

**Project:** Apple GPU programming framework  
**License:** Included with macOS SDK (free)  
**Source:** https://developer.apple.com/metal/  
**Use in FlexAID∆S:** Optional GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

**Note:** Proprietary but freely available on macOS. FlexAID∆S uses public Metal APIs.

## Scientific Methods & Parameters

### FlexAID Core Method (Apache-2.0)

**Original Project:** NRGlab/FlexAID  
**License:** Apache License 2.0  
**Source:** https://github.com/NRGlab/FlexAID  
**Papers:**
- Gaudreault & Najmanovich (2015). *J. Chem. Inf. Model.* 55(7):1323-36.  
  DOI: [10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00078](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00078)

**Use in FlexAID∆S:** Genetic algorithm docking engine, NATURaL scoring function parameters (40-SYBYL atom type interaction matrix), side-chain flexibility framework

**Notes:**
- FlexAID∆S is derived from the Apache-2.0 licensed FlexAID
- Energy parameters (ε_ij values) are reused from original FlexAID
- Original docking engine architecture extended with entropy calculations
- Full Apache-2.0 compatibility maintained

---

### NRGRank Method (Scientific Inspiration Only - GPL-3.0)

**Project:** NRGlab/NRGRank  
**License:** GNU General Public License v3.0  
**Source:** https://github.com/NRGlab/NRGRank (NOT INCLUDED AS DEPENDENCY)  
**Paper:** Gaudreault et al. (bioRxiv preprint, 2024 - citation pending publication)

**Relationship to FlexAID∆S:**
- **Scientific inspiration:** NRGRank's cube screening algorithm informed FreeNRG design
- **No code dependency:** FlexAID∆S and FreeNRG do NOT import, link to, or incorporate NRGRank code
- **Clean-room implementation:** Methods reimplemented from published equations under Apache-2.0
- **License isolation:** GPL-3.0 does not propagate to FlexAID∆S (see clean-room policy)

**Why NRGRank is not a dependency:**
- Copyright protects *expression* (code), not *ideas* (algorithms)
- Published scientific methods are not copyrightable
- Independent implementation from mathematical descriptions avoids GPL contamination
- FlexAID∆S maintains full Apache-2.0 permissiveness

**Citation in Scientific Work:**
> "The ultra-HTS cube screening method was inspired by NRGRank (Gaudreault et al., bioRxiv 2024). FlexAID∆S reimplements this approach from first principles with Shannon entropy extensions."

## Compliance Notes

### For Users

**No GPL obligations:** FlexAID∆S can be used in proprietary software, modified freely, and relicensed under any terms. No source disclosure required for downstream works.

**Optional dependencies:** CUDA and Metal are optional. FlexAID∆S includes CPU-only fallback implementations.

**No viral licenses:** All included dependencies are permissive or have library exceptions. No strong copyleft propagation.

### For Contributors

**CLA Required:** All contributions must be submitted under Apache License 2.0 terms.

**No GPL code:** Do not submit patches incorporating GPL-licensed code. See [docs/licensing/clean-room-policy.md](docs/licensing/clean-room-policy.md) for detailed GPL avoidance strategy.

**Dependency review:** Proposed new dependencies must use Apache-2.0, BSD, MIT, PSF, or MPL 2.0 licenses. GPL and AGPL forbidden.

### For Redistributors

**Binary distribution:** Include this file and main LICENSE in all binary packages.

**Source distribution:** Preserve all copyright notices in source headers.

**CUDA/Metal:** If distributing binaries with GPU support, note that users must accept NVIDIA EULA (CUDA) or Apple terms (Metal) separately. Do not redistribute CUDA Toolkit itself.

**FlexAID attribution:** Retain Apache-2.0 notice for FlexAID-derived components.
