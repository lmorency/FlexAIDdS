## 1. Executive Summary

The `GrandPartitionFunction` module implements a **grand canonical ensemble** framework for competitive ligand binding within the FlexAIDdS molecular docking engine. Unlike conventional docking tools that score ligands independently, this module treats the receptor binding site as a thermodynamic system where multiple ligands compete for occupation. The approach yields concentration-dependent binding probabilities, pairwise selectivity ratios, and thermodynamically rigorous free energy rankings — all derived from partition functions computed over conformational ensembles sampled by the genetic algorithm.

Key results:

- **Competitive selectivity** computed as a first-class thermodynamic quantity (not post-hoc score subtraction)
- **Concentration-dependent occupancy** via fugacity/activity terms (`z_i = c_i / c°`)
- **Numerically stable** log-space arithmetic handling partition functions spanning 10^500+
- **Cross-ligand knowledge transfer** through Bayesian conformer priors and binding-site hotspots
- **Thread-safe concurrent accumulation** supporting parallel multi-ligand docking campaigns

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Grand Canonical Ensemble

The binding site is modeled as a system that can be in one of N+1 states: empty (apo) or occupied by one of N ligands. The grand partition function is:

```
Ξ = 1 + Σᵢ zᵢ·Zᵢ
```

where:

| Symbol | Definition | Units |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Ξ | Grand partition function | dimensionless |
| 1 | Empty site contribution | dimensionless |
| zᵢ | Fugacity = cᵢ / c° | dimensionless |
| cᵢ | Ligand i concentration | M |
| c° | Standard state concentration | 1 M |
| Zᵢ | Canonical partition function of ligand i | dimensionless |

The canonical partition function Zᵢ is computed by `StatMechEngine` from the Boltzmann-weighted conformational ensemble:

```
Zᵢ = Σ_j exp(−β·E_j) · w_j
```

where the sum runs over all sampled poses j with energies E_j and weights w_j, and β = 1/(k_B·T).

### 2.2 Thermodynamic Observables

From Ξ, all thermodynamic observables follow:

**Binding probability** (concentration-dependent):

```
p(ligand_i) = zᵢ·Zᵢ / Ξ = exp(ln zᵢ + ln Zᵢ − ln Ξ)
```

**Empty probability** (apo site):

```
p(empty) = 1 / Ξ = exp(−ln Ξ)
```

**Intrinsic Helmholtz free energy** (concentration-independent):

```
F_i = −kT · ln Zᵢ    [kcal/mol]
```

**Binding free energy** (vs. reference state):

```
ΔG_bind = F_bound − F_ref
```

**Selectivity ratio** (overflow-safe):

```
S(A/B) = (z_A·Z_A) / (z_B·Z_B) = exp(ln Z_A − ln Z_B + ln(c_A/c_B))
```

**Log-selectivity** (always finite):

```
ln S(A/B) = ln Z_A − ln Z_B + ln(c_A/c_B)
```

### 2.3 Log-Space Arithmetic

All partition function values are stored as `ln Z`. The log-sum-exp identity computes `ln Ξ` without evaluating any `exp()` argument larger than `max_val`:

```
ln Ξ = max_val + ln(Σᵢ exp(xᵢ − max_val))
```

where the set {xᵢ} includes 0 (empty site) and all `ln(zᵢ·Zᵢ)` values. This guarantees numerical stability for partition functions spanning hundreds of orders of magnitude.

## 3. Implementation Architecture

### 3.1 Class Hierarchy

```
TargetServer
├── GrandPartitionFunction    (owns GPF state + mutex)
├── TargetKnowledgeBase       (conformer priors, hotspots)
├── TargetValidation          (structure validation)
└── Session management        (atomic session IDs)
```

`GrandPartitionFunction` owns its own `std::mutex` — all public methods are thread-safe. `TargetServer` holds a separate mutex only for knowledge-base operations. This avoids nested locking and deadlock risk.

### 3.2 Data Storage

Each ligand is stored as a `LigandEntry`:

```cpp
struct LigandEntry {
    double log_Z;    // intrinsic ln(Z_i)
    double log_zZ;   // ln(z_i · Z_i) = ln(c_i/c°) + ln(Z_i)
};
```

The dual-field design separates:
- **Intrinsic quantities** (`log_Z`): used for free energy, ranking — concentration-independent
- **Grand canonical quantities** (`log_zZ`): used for probabilities, selectivity, Ξ — concentration-dependent

### 3.3 Ligand Update Semantics

| Operation | Effect on log_Z | Effect on log_zZ | Use case |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| `add_ligand` | Set | Set (= log_c + log_Z) | New ligand |
| `overwrite_ligand` | Replace | Replace (preserves log_c) | Re-dock with better protocol |
| `merge_ligand` | log_sum_exp | log_sum_exp | Combine independent ensembles |
| `remove_ligand` | Removed | Removed | Discard ligand |

**Merge** computes `ln(Z_old + Z_new)` via log-sum-exp, correctly combining independent conformational ensembles without double-counting. Concentration is preserved through both overwrite and merge.

### 3.4 Numerical Stability Guarantees

| Scenario | Protection |
|----------|-----------|
| Partition functions spanning 10^500 | Log-space storage, log-sum-exp |
| Selectivity ratios > 10^300 | `log_selectivity()` returns raw Δ; `selectivity()` returns ±Inf/0.0 beyond ±700 |
| Empty ensemble | Returns ln Ξ = 0, p(empty) = 1.0 |
| Extreme concentration ratios | Absorbed into log_zZ, no overflow |
| No heap allocation for Ξ | Single-pass, no std::vector |

## 4. Drug Discovery Applications

### 4.1 Selectivity Screening

Traditional workflow: dock ligand A to target T, dock ligand A to off-target O, compare scores post-hoc.

GPF workflow: dock all ligands to target T in one campaign, compute pairwise selectivity directly.

**Advantage**: Selectivity accounts for the full conformational ensemble of each ligand-target pair, not just the best pose. A ligand that adopts a single favorable pose has different selectivity than one that populates ten moderately favorable poses — the entropy contribution is captured automatically.

### 4.2 Concentration-Dependent Occupancy

Setting ligand concentrations to physiological values enables:

- **Dose-response prediction**: Sweep c_i to generate occupancy curves
- **Therapeutic window estimation**: Compare occupancy at therapeutic vs toxic concentrations
- **Combination therapy modeling**: Multiple drugs at different concentrations competing for the same site
- **Tissue-specific predictions**: Different drug concentrations in plasma vs CSF vs intracellular

Example: Drug A (1 nM affinity, 10 μM plasma concentration) vs Drug B (100 pM affinity, 100 nM plasma concentration) — the GPF correctly predicts which drug actually occupies the binding site in vivo.

### 4.3 Lead Optimization with Ensemble Feedback

The `TargetServer` accumulates knowledge across ligand docking sessions:

1. **Conformer priors**: Bayesian posterior over receptor conformations weighted by binding probability. Well-binding ligands "vote" on the receptor conformation, improving priors for subsequent ligands.

2. **Binding site hotspots**: Energy-weighted grid points accumulated across all sessions, building a consensus pharmacophore map.

3. **Iterative refinement**: `overwrite_ligand` for re-docking with better protocols; `merge_ligand` for combining expanded ensembles.

This creates a positive feedback loop: better priors → better docking → better priors.

### 4.4 Virtual Screening Campaigns

For large-scale virtual screening:

1. Dock all candidates (thread-safe concurrent sessions)
2. Rank by intrinsic free energy (concentration-independent)
3. Apply physiological concentrations to compute actual occupancy
4. Compute selectivity matrices for lead candidates
5. Re-dock top hits with finer grids (overwrite or merge)

The thread-safe `create_session()` / `register_result()` pattern supports parallel docking of 50+ ligands with automatic GPF accumulation.

## 6. Limitations and Future Directions

### 6.1 Current Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Potential solution |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Single binding site | Cannot model multi-site targets (allosteric + orthosteric) | Product of grand partition functions |
| No cooperativity | Assumes independent single-site binding | Multi-site Hamiltonian |
| Fixed temperature | Cannot sweep temperature for melting curves | Re-instantiate GPF per temperature |
| Implicit solvent in "1" | Empty site does not model explicit water competition | WaterMap-style solvent thermodynamics |
| No ligand-ligand interactions | Cannot model self-competition or dimerization | Higher-order terms in Ξ |
| Standard state 1 M | Dilute nM–pM concentrations dominated by log(c) term | Physically correct; user must account for it |

### 6.2 Proposed Extensions

1. **Multi-site grand partition function**: `Ξ = Π_sites Ξ_site` for targets with multiple independent binding sites, enabling allosteric modulator screening.

2. **Temperature sweeps**: Integrate with existing parallel tempering framework to generate full van't Hoff plots (ln K vs 1/T) for entropy/enthalpy decomposition.

3. **Water displacement scoring**: Replace the "1" (empty site) with `Z_water = Π_sites exp(−β·G_water)` to model the thermodynamic cost of displacing ordered water molecules.

4. **Time-dependent occupancy**: Combine with pharmacokinetic concentration-time profiles [c(t)] to predict dynamic target engagement.

5. **Multi-target selectivity matrices**: Extend to compute selectivity across multiple targets simultaneously (one GPF per target, cross-target comparison).

## 8. Conclusions

The `GrandPartitionFunction` module provides a thermodynamically rigorous framework for competitive ligand binding that goes beyond conventional single-ligand, single-pose docking. Its key contributions to the drug discovery workflow are:

1. **Principled selectivity prediction** grounded in statistical mechanics rather than score subtraction
2. **Physiologically relevant predictions** through concentration-dependent binding probabilities
3. **Ensemble-level thermodynamics** capturing entropic contributions from conformational diversity
4. **Scalable concurrent screening** with thread-safe accumulation across parallel docking sessions
5. **Iterative refinement** through knowledge accumulation across ligand campaigns

The implementation maintains numerical stability across 1000+ orders of magnitude through log-space arithmetic, requires no external dependencies beyond the C++ standard library, and integrates seamlessly with the existing FlexAIDdS pipeline through the `TargetServer` interface.
